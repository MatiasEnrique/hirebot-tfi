EMAIL SERVICE USAGE EXAMPLES
============================

The EmailService has been successfully implemented in the SERVICES layer following the project's architectural patterns.

CONFIGURATION:
- Email settings are stored in Web.config under appSettings
- Multilanguage support through GlobalResources.resx files
- Service is disabled by default for security (Email.EnableEmailService = "false")

USAGE EXAMPLES:

1. Password Recovery Email:
```csharp
using SERVICES;

// Send password recovery email
bool result = EmailService.SendPasswordRecoveryEmail(
    userEmail: "user@example.com",
    userName: "John Doe",
    resetToken: "abc123resettoken",
    resetUrl: "https://localhost:44383/ResetPassword.aspx"
);

if (result)
{
    // Email sent successfully
}
else 
{
    // Check logs for error details
}
```

2. Password Change Confirmation:
```csharp
using SERVICES;

// Send password change confirmation
bool result = EmailService.SendPasswordChangeConfirmationEmail(
    userEmail: "user@example.com",
    userName: "John Doe"
);
```

3. Welcome Email for New Users:
```csharp
using SERVICES;

// Send welcome email
bool result = EmailService.SendWelcomeEmail(
    userEmail: "newuser@example.com",
    userName: "Jane Smith",
    loginUrl: "https://localhost:44383/SignIn.aspx"
);
```

4. Test Email (for configuration verification):
```csharp
using SERVICES;

// Send test email to verify configuration
bool result = EmailService.SendTestEmail("admin@example.com");
```

CONFIGURATION STEPS TO ENABLE:
1. Set Email.EnableEmailService = "true" in Web.config
2. Configure SMTP settings:
   - Email.Username = your email username
   - Email.Password = your email password or app password
3. Update Email.FromAddress and Email.FromName as needed
4. Test with SendTestEmail() method first

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Service is disabled by default
- All emails are logged through LogService
- Sensitive configuration stored in Web.config (not hardcoded)
- Email validation and error handling implemented
- Resource disposal properly managed

MULTILANGUAGE SUPPORT:
- Email templates automatically use current culture
- Spanish and English translations provided
- Fallback to key name if translation missing
- Uses HttpContext.GetGlobalResourceObject for localization

ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE:
- Follows existing SERVICES layer patterns
- Uses LogService for comprehensive logging
- Proper error handling and validation
- Configuration caching for performance
- Thread-safe implementation
- SOLID principles applied
